# demo_ppc_get_via_api
This is a demo repo for one of projects I have done.

The task was to get PPC data from a special web service via API.
The Google Sheet lists the domains for which you want to get this data.
A mechanism for importing from a web service and checking for errors and typos was implemented.

Here is the Google sheet file: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16Q8vGKnXMjtKdKNYoXKpPON9FCIGIsrjKq2EZtK_Im8/edit#gid=0
